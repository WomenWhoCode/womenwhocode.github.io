 		<h3 id="what_wwcode"><a href="#top_page">What is Women Who Code?</a></h3>
 	 		<p>Women Who Code is a global nonprofit dedicated to inspiring women to excel in their engineering careers. For more information visit <a href="https://www.womenwhocode.com">Women Who Code</a></p>

 		<h3 id="core_team"><a href="#top_page">Where does the Core Team fit in?</a></h3>
 		<p>We have setup a core team within WWCode. The purpose of the core team is to establish visibility and alignment of our tech projects that address the vision and mission of Women Who Code.</p>

		<h4>Visibility</h4>
		<p>Being opened sourced, having clear documentation and highlight contributors on current and upcoming project work.</p>

		<h4>Alignment</h4>
		<p>Seeking input from contributors, members and organizational leaders on current and upcoming project work.</p>

		<h4>Goals</h4>
		<p>Our goal is to have a technically diverse team comprised of people with domain knowledge in software development, data science, analytics, design, project management and product management.</p>

		<h4>Members</h4>
		<p><a href="https://github.com/vnu">Vinu</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zassmin">Zassmin</a>, <a href="http://leftbrain.kaitlynhova.com/">Kaitlyn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ogormans">Sinead</a></p>

		<h3 id="project_reviewers"><a href="#top_page">Where do project Reviewers fit in?</a></h3>
 		<p>We encourage each contributor to review Pull Requests and make valuable comments. </p>

		<p>Reviewers are people who review pull requests for each of our projects and give valuable feedback. Reviews are contributors who have agreed to review pull requests within 24hrs, have been contributing to the repository for a longer term and have a larger overall understanding of the code base. Reviewers give a final thumbs up before a Pull Request is merged.</p>

		</p>Reviewers are found in repository READMEs. </p>

		<h5>Identifying Priority Issues</h5>
		<p>We want to make it easier for our contributors to identify priority issues, as a result we’ve started a weekly milestones(Sprint). This also means, we will prioritize issues in the weekly milestones more quickly for release. And of course, we will recognize you through our weekly Maker Bytes. </p>

		<h5>How are priority issues identified?</h5>
		<p>Core-team reviews the WomenWhoCode product roadmap and creates weekly milestones(Sprint). There are various labels to help contributors pick the feature that they have the expertise to do and the time to put in. </p>

		<h5>Milestone Format:</h5> <p>Mon xxth - yyth YYYY Sprint  --- Eg: Apr 23rd-29th 2016 Sprint</p>

		<p>Each of the issues may have various label describing the following:</p>
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>Feature type: JobBoard, Networking etc.,</li>
			<li>The estimated size of the feature: small, medium, large </li>
			<li>Labels describing the type of feature you are working on Frontend, backend, product love</li>
			<li>Even more minor details describing whether is it html / css, javascript, database etc.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>We like feedback and only know how to improve when you tell us what’s good or what could be better. Feel free to send suggestions to core-team@womenwhocode.com or ping us on slack. </p>

		<p>Did you find an another interesting issue that is currently not a part of the milestone?</p>
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>Check whether the issue is already in our issues list. If not, please create the issue with details </li>
			<li>Comment stating you are working on this issue for the current sprint cc/ @womenwhocode/core and start working on the issue. </li>
		</ul>

		<p>The core-team will review the issue and will let you know if there are any blockers in proceeding with the issue. Please note, we will prioritize the review of issues that are in the milestone.</p>
